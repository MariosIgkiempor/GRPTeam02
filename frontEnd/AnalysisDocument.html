            <div class="box"><strong>Self-Organising Map</strong><br>
              A Self-Organising Map (SOM) converts complex relationships within data of high dimensions into simple relationships in lower dimensions, all while preserving the most important relationships of the starting data.
              <br><img src="./DecisionTree/Self-Organising Map.png"></img>
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>K-Means Clustering</strong><br>
              K-means clustering classiﬁes a set of data into k clusters (where k > 0) by assigning it to a centroid (central location of a cluster). This is achieved by assigning it to the nearest centroid. When each data point has been assigned, k centroids are recalculated and the datapoints are reassigned. This process of deﬁning and assigning to new centroids is repeated until no data points move

            <div class="box"><strong>Principle Component Analysis</strong><br>
              Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ﬁnds a small subset of combinations of correlated parameters which have the most inﬂuence on variation within the dataset.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Linear Regression</strong><br>
              Linear Regression is a form of predictive analysis where the values of (an) independent variable(s) are used to predict future values of a dependent variable by ﬁtting a line through the values the variables.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network</strong><br>
              Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks are networks of processing nodes (perceptrons), each connected via a weight. The weighted sum of all input values into a node is ran through an activation function. If the function outputs a number higher than a threshold, its weighted sum is propagated into the input of all nodes connected to its output.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Multiclass Neural Network</strong><br>
              A Multiclass Neural Network extends on a neural network by providing one output neuron for each possible output class of a given problem.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Random Forest Regression</strong><br>
              Random Forests select a random subset of features, observe their outputs, and generate a decision tree based on the features selected. This process is repeates lots of times (hundreds to thousands), and each tree is averaged into the ﬁnal decision tree.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Logistic Regression</strong><br>
              Logistic Regression is a method for binary prediction when the outputs are dichotomous (true or false). It is used to ﬁnd the relationship of one dichotomous variable, and one or more other independent variable.
              <br><img src="./DecisionTree/Logistic Regression.png"></img>
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Multiclass Logistic Regression</strong><br>
              A generalisation of Logistic Regression, which can identify more than two possible outcomes.
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Naive Bayesian Network</strong><br>
              A Naive Bayesian Network calculates the conditional probability of each attribute of a class given its label. By applying Bayes rule, labels are classiﬁed based on the instances of each attribute. Its na¨ıvety stems from the fact that it assumes that all attributes are conditionally independent on the class.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Support Vector Machine</strong><br>
              Support Vector Machines take an input vector and map it, non-linearly, into a higher dimension feature space, in which a linear, highly generalisable, decision surface is created.
              <br><img src="./DecisionTree/Support Vector Machine.png"></img>
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Self-Training</strong><br>
              Self training trains a model with labeled data, which is used to classify unlabeled data. The unlabeled data that the model classiﬁed with the highest conﬁdence are added back to the set of labeled data.

            <div class="box"><strong>Deep Learning</strong><br>
              Enter an object, perform multi-dimensional operations layer by layer, and finally output the result. Deep learning is actually a relative expert system. The previous judgment is a top-down idea defined by a large number of "If - Then" rules. Deep learning is a model of artificial neural network bottom-up thinking, trying to imitate the patterns of communication between neurons in the brain and processing information.
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Recurrent Neural Network</strong><br>
              The idea behind circular neural networks is to use sequence information. Cyclic neural networks are called loops because they perform the same tasks for each element in the sequence, and the output depends on the previous calculations.
              <br><img src="./DecisionTree/Recurrent Neural Network.png"></img>
            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Time Delay Neural Network</strong><br>
              The time delay neural network (TDNN) is the first model to use multiple CNN layers for ASR. This model applies convolution operations on both the time and frequency axes. Time-Delay allows it to learn the timing dependencies between features.

            </div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Feature Selection Principal Component Analysis</strong><br>
              PCA is used to find out which feature is the best to describe the variance in a dataset. It is mostly used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset which contained a great amount of data. Therefore applying machine learning becomes more practical when the original data has an inherently high dimension.
