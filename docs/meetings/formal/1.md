## Discussed

- data sets to start with
  - UCI repository (Google it);
  - categorises everything for us
- start storing the data in a sensible way
- build a package to tell what type of data it is
- NoSQL would be suitable for heterogenous datatypes
- **write a document on Scrum vs Kanban**
  - pros and cons of both
- someone needs to read up on h2o, weka, R (machine learning tools)
- the websites should visualise existing datasets
  - stretch targets: user can input datasets
- expecting a requirements document before next Monday (maybe)
- have some deliverable every week (minutes, a paragraph, a diagram, anything) on Friday evening
