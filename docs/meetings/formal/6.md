## Things Discussed
- use the passive voice in the report
- non-functional requirements - Chris will send us some today
    - consistent (reproducable)
    - NOT probabilistic
- improving the user feedback is preferable over doing machine learning ourselves
- could include options for the user to choose a) decision tree b) "intelligent methods"
- look into nearest similar tool
- use case diagram ok - customer does not want to edit datasets
- Chris will send 5-10 CSV files to prototype with
