    - someone needs to start thinking about what the front end will look like (Hao + Xinyang)
    - someone needs to write a document on decision making (kanban vs scrum) (Boyuan)
    - someone needs to write a document on NoSQL vs MySQL (Mario)
    - someone needs to start reading about other machine learning tools (Boyuan + Xinjie)

## Things to ask the supervisor
