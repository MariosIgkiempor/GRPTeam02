- could ask the user for additional information
 - images?
 - time?
 - static data?
- dataset might need preprocessing?
    - eg for outliers/missing values
    - dirty data? eg wrong datatypes/110%/negative values
- could add interactivity/images etc at the end
    - start simple
    - could have interactive visuals
    - potentially actual machine learning?
- could give an opinion and then ask questions later to improve the answer
- svm ranking?
- does not have to be a website
    - definitely not a mobile app (teaching tool)
- could visualise the rule tree but not necessarily - lose mystery
