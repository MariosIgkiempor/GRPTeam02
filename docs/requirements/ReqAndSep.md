### Requirements by customer

* Parses datasets and suggests the best machine learning approaches for modeling that dataset

1. Links to these datasets or the datasets themselves will be supplied

2. Be used as both a prefilter for machine learning and as a teaching aid.

3. Require a degree of data visualization in the front end and a comprehensive, extendible database

4. A rule-based approach will probably be sufficient to
as certain what is the ideal machine learning approach for each dataset

5. The client has significant knowledge of machine learning methods and some of this knowledge will need to be captured to facilitate the decision making process.

### Specification
  1.1 Build the database which can store the data in every dataset
  
  1.2 The user can upload the dataset, and the dataset will need to be stored in the database when upload
  
  1.3 The datasets are availible for customers to download
  
  1.4 The datasets' information need to be shown to customer and the information need to be provided by the uploader, the information including data type such as vision, static etc.
  
  1.5 The datasets need preprocessing, such as outliers, missing values etc.

  2.1 A functionality that the website can analyze the dataset and provide the best machine learning approach is required.
  
  2.2 *When do we analyse the dataset and get the best machine learning approach? As soon as the costomer upload the file or when they need the get them like clicking a buttom?*
  
  2.3 The reason why that approach is best needs to be provided
  
  2.4 There are different cataglogues of machine learning. And each cataglogue provides the algorithm for the machine learning and the sample datasets.
    - *Need a database to store the information for datasets*
    - A search engine which can search for both the datasets' name and machine learning approaches.

  3.1 Different types of the graph need to be provided
    - Bar chart
    - Scatter chart
    - Others
    
  3.2 The costomer need able to add, delete or change the database
    - *The datasets need to be changed at same time*
    
  4.1 Add interactivity, images and interactive visuals at the result page
  
  5.1 Mapping opinions: 1)RBS; 2)Deterministic mode; 3)Probabilistic mode
