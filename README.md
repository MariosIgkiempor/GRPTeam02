An application is required that parses datasets and suggests the best machine learning approaches for modelling that dataset. These datasets will be supplied. This tool will be used as both a prefilter for machine learning and as a teaching aid.

## TODO
[] Establish a Kanban workflow outline
  [] Register on trello
[] Database design
  [] Implement the database
  [] Start importing/archiving data
  [] Start querying the database
