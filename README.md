## Project Outline
**Project 15 - Machine Learning Dataset Parsing Tool**

An application is required that parses datasets and suggests the best machine learning approaches for modelling that dataset. These datasets will be supplied. This tool will be used as both a prefilter for machine learning and as a teaching aid.

**User Requirements**

- capture knowledge to facilitate processing of data using a rule-based approach
- an extendible database
- data visualisation

## TODO
**Establish a Kanban workflow outline**
- [x] Register on Trello
- [x] Create the Kanban board
[Link to our Kanban board on Trello](https://trello.com/b/oPBUJWjp/grpteam02)
- [x] Document decision on using Kanban

**Database design**
- [x] Implement the database
- [x] Document decision on using a NoSQL databse
- [x] Start importing/archiving data
- [x] Start querying the database

**Data Parsing**
- [ ] Document Javascript vs Python difficulties
- [ ] Find more in depth anomaly detection algorithm
- [ ] Refactor existing sources to use more sohpisticated libraries

**Front End**
- [ ] Basic home page
- [ ] List of all the data sets currently stored on the database
- [ ] Page to allow data set to be uploaded to the server for parsin
